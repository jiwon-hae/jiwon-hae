# 👋 Hi, I'm Jiwon Hae
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an AI Engineer and M.S. in Computer Science (AI specialization) at the University of Southern California, currently interning at ReferU.AI. <br><br>
With over 4 years of experience as a software engineer, I specialize in building intelligent systems that combine cutting-edge research with real-world application. My focus areas include LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, multimodal AI, and agentic architectures for adaptive decision-making.

<br>

## 🧠 Research
#### ASTRA: A Negotiation Agent with Adaptive and Strategic Reasoning through Action in Dynamic Offer Optimization - [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07129)
- Fine-tuned Flan-T5 using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on HPC infrastructure to generate strategic dialogue in multi-issue negotiation scenarios.
- Designed a consistency checker using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and the OpenAI API to ensure alignment between LLM-generated offers and inferred partner preferences.
- Evaluated agent performance across 100+ negotiation runs using BLEU, F1, and Pareto optimality; achieved a 66% reduction in walk-away rates.

## 🌟 Projects
#### Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation - [GitHub](https://github.com/jiwon-hae/EmpatheticMLLM)
- Developed a multimodal empathetic response generater by integrating Meta’s [ImageBind](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageBind) for cross-modal representation learning.
- Responsible for active speaker detection and face cropping from video, as well as fine-tuning the LLaMA-based Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for empathetic response generation.

#### New Benchmark for Real-world Visual Navigation in a Simulator
- Developing a novel benchmark simulator for real-world visual navigation using [Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) for photorealistic scene rendering.
- Responsible for dataset processing using ROS and Open3D, and for implementing Navisim, a training arena built with [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) for agent-based navigation.

#### GOSSIPS: An agentic RAG system that maps influence and unveils celebrity connections through graphs and gossip. - [GitHub](https://github.com/jiwon-hae/gossips)
- Agentic RAG system powered by a knowledge graph that tracks and connects rumors, relationships, and influence in the celebrity ecosystem.
- Transforms unstructured stories into structured insights, enabling agents to reason over the latest gossip and uncover hidden connections.
